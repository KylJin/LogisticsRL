# LogisticsRL
The implementation &amp; visualization of the Logistics environment for Reinforcement Learning.

## Notice
1. The `map/map_0.json` is not tuned yet, so please don't use it.
2. The `generator.py` is still being tested. So if you use it to generate a new map, the simulation result may not be so satisfying.
3. The `examples` is used for Jidi platform's submission.
